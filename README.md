1. It contains an input box which when click will create another input which show the text written in first inbox.
2. When we write a new task and press enter it will show inside the list below.
3. There are two tasks which are default.
4. We can edit the list tasks by double clicking on the task itself.
5. If after editing we want the previous task we will press esc key to go to original task.
6. We can delete the task.
7. Also this contains the three buttons which will show the completed tasks, active tasks and all tasks when clicked.


So in this app everything is there which is required for a to-do app.
